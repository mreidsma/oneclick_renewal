#README - One Click Renewals

---

IMPORTANT: I developed this before I realized that Millennium's forms support both POST and GET. So, you don't need this at all. Just do a GET request to the renewal form! To do one-click renewal if you use the traditional Millennium login (name & code), use this:

millennium.url/patroninfo/*/items?name={name}&code={barcode}&renew0={itemnumber}

And if you need them to pass through sign-in, use this:

millennium.url/patroninfo/*/items?renew0={itemnumber}

A big thanks to Brad Czerniak (@ao5357) for pointing this out to me.

This tool was developed by Matthew Reidsma in HTML, PHP, and Javascript to let users renew books with one click from their Millennium notification emails. It's a work in progress. We hope you find it useful.

INSTALLATION

Aaron Schmidt (http://walkingpaper.org) asked on Twitter whether anyone was doing one-click renewals in from notification emails [1]. I thought this sounded like a great idea, but I could think of a few obstacles Millennium, our ILS, would throw up right off the bat:

1. Renewal form uses POST and not GET [See IMPORTANT above, since this is not true.]
2. Can't send HTML emails as notifications

The 2 easy solutions were out: I can't just generate an email that would pass the necessary variables (item#, patron id, and a few technical variables) to the form, since the form doesn't accept GET. Can't embed a POST form in the email to send those variables. My solution patches the problems with both of these.

I literally made some middleware. It works like this:

Edit line 5 in the index.php to have your library's path to Millennium. Just edit the part between https:// and the next backslash ("/"). Upload it somewhere to your server, like mylib.edu/renew. Now:

Create a link in Millennium's notifications to the renew.php file and pass 2 variables*: the patron id (as var p) and the item you want to renew (as i). Currently the script will only work for single items. (I wrote it in 8 minutes. I've already spent longer on this README.) You should have a link like this:

http://mylib.edu/renew/?i=i9873483&p=983749283

When the user clicks that link, the attached file runs and grabs those 2 variables you passed, populates a form that will send the data to Millennium as a POST request, and then submits the form. It happens fast, so the user likely doesn't know they are redirected. They will have to log in if they aren't already.

* The wildcard here is the Millennium notification. I'm not actually sure if I can create the needed URL with those variables within the notification system. If not, I'll need to come up with something else.

This is a work in progress, but I thought I'd get the code out to others who might want to test and hack on it. Am I missing something stupid?
